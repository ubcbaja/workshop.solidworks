            <h6><b>What is Bottum-up design?</b></h6>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Bottom-up design is the <b>traditional method</b></li>
            <li>You first design and model parts, then <b>insert them into an assembly</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h6><b>What is Top-down design? </b></h6>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Top-down design is also referred to as <b>in-context design</b></li>
                <li>In Top-down design, parts' shapes, sizes, and locations can be <b>designed in the assembly</b></li>
            </ul>

            Q1 - Power Supply Bracket -> Top-down or bottom-up?<br>
            Q2 - Wiring Harness -> Top-Down, why? Can we open it as its own Part?<br>
            Q3 - What is a Control Sketch? How can it make our lives easier?</p>
            
            
            <br>
            
            
            <h6><b>Let's DO an example!</b></h6>

We will be designing a bracket to mount it on the power supply unit in the 2018/2019 Mechatronics TOP LEVEL. In order to do this we will also need to make a hole in the power supply enclosure to allow airflow. This is a very open ended problem - guidance will be provided but the amount of <b>in-context design</b> to implement is up to you. Be prepared to justify why you did things the way you did.</p>

            <h4>General Suggestions</h4>
            
            <p>NOTE: The following suggestions are unrelated to today's exercise.</p>
            
            <p>I've noticed some specific areas where students consistently encounter difficulties and hope that the following suggestions can help improve your experience.</p>
            
            <p>Avoid saving parts with <b>"Rolled Back" States</b>. This tool is mostly for making temporary changes to your part or assembly. Otherwise, you are constantly prompted when opening assemblies to roll the part forward and often the "forgotten" features that have been rolled back will cause mating errors if rolled forward - The end user usually doesn't know if the part should be rolled forward or left as is. If you need multiple configurations, use Configurations (Refer to <a href="https://help.solidworks.com/2020/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/r_welcome_sw_online_help.htm" target="_blank"> SolidWorks Help</a>).</p>
            
            <p>Be organized in your Assemblies! It will save everyone time and hassle. How does one do this? USE FOLDERS! Here is an example: 
            </p>

            <br><br>
            
            <p>To make your life that much easier, you can view components and assemblies in your SolidWorks Feature Tree by their PDM 'Description' and not just their part-number. Right click the highest level part/assembly in your Feature Tree and select the following:</p>
